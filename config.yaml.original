# config.yaml.original is a "clean" version that you can refer to after you have edited config.yaml.
# You can even set up a git pre-commit hook to replace config.yaml with this clean version to avoid commiting an edited version.

# Keys:

# projects: Only resources in these projects will get labeled.
# But if the value is empty, *all* projects in the organization are included.
projects: []

# plugins: Only these plugins are enabled.
# For example, list some of these: bigquery, buckets, bigtable, disks,  cloudsql, instances, snaphots, subscriptions, topics
# But if the value is empty, *all* plugins are enabled
plugins: []

# iris_prefix is prefixed to the key of each label that is added.
iris_prefix: iris

# If from_project is True, then for each resource we are labeling, copy the labels from its project onto it.
from_project: True

# If label_all_on_cron is True, then all resource types will be labeled on every cron (Clouid Scheduler) cycle.
# This is good for labeling existing resources on first running Iris3
# If label_all_on_cron is False, to save money, then only plugins which return True on relabel_on_cron() or False in is_labeled_on_creation()
# get labeled on cron.
label_all_on_cron: True

# Change this before first deployment for added security in communication between PubSub and the Iris App on App Engine.
# You could even re-generate a new token per deployment.
# Note that this approach is not very secure, though it was was once recommended by Google.
# However, so long as  your GCP project is secure, this token protects against unwanted invocations.
# Also, the worst an invocation can do is re-trigger idempotent behavior, with possible DOS.
